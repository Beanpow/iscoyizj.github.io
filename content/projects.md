> This is the page for some of my projects during first year of master at UCSD:
1. Cheetah: Foreground Segmentation
2. CamOILi: Camera Inertial LiDAR Particle Filter SLAM
3. Mario RL: Playing Super Mario in policy gradient method
4. Yolokey: Object detection and keypoint detection in ROS
5. RSS2018 Spotlight: Dense Spatial Segmentation from Sparse Semantic Information

## Cheetah: Foreground Segmentation
Given training set of foreground/background, how to tell where is the cheetah.

## CamOILi: Camera Inertial LiDAR Particle Filter SLAM
If we have RGBD camera, IMU and LiDAR, how can our robot realize the world?

## Yolokey: Object detection and keypoint detection in ROS
An tensorflow implementation of [stacked hourglass network](https://github.com/geopavlakos/object3d) to detect category-specific keypoint and thanks to the [yolo-ros package](https://github.com/leggedrobotics/darknet_ros).

## RSS2018 workshop spotlight: 

**Qiaojun Feng, Yue Meng, Nikolay Atanasov, Dense Spatial Segmentation from Sparse Semantic Information \[[pdf](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1b1C4SMfS0aPwHM7mT4TSl59rD6pnD6gY/view)\]**

Abstractâ€”This paper develops an environment representation that affords reasoning about the occupancy of space, necessary for safe navigation, and about the identity of objects, necessary for complex task interpretation.
